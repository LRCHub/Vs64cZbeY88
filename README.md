```
Weight of the world
on your shoulders
I kiss your waist
and ease your mind
I must be favored to know ya
I take my hands and
trace your lines
It's the way that we can ride
It's the way that we can ride
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Think I met you in another life
So break me off another time
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
You wrap around me and you
give me life
And that's why night after night
I'll be fuckin' you right
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday, Saturday,
Sunday (A week)
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday,
seven days a week
Every hour every minute
every second,
you know night after night
I'll be fuckin' you right,
seven days a week
You love when I jump right in
All of me I'm offering
Show you what devotion is
Deeper than the ocean is
Wind it back I'll take it slow
Leave you with that afterglow
Show you what devotion is
Deeper than the ocean is
It's the way that we can ride
It's the way that we can ride
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Think I met you in another life
So break me off another time
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
You wrap around me and you
give me life
And that's why night after night
I'll be fuckin' you right
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday, Saturday,
Sunday (A week)
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday,
seven days a week
Every hour every minute
every second,
you know night after night
I'll be fuckin' you right,
seven days a week
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday, Saturday,
Sunday (A week)
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday,
seven days a week
Every hour every minute
every second,
you know night after night
I'll be fuckin' you right,
seven days a week (Big Latto)
Tightly take control,
tightly take his soul
Take your phone
and put it in the camera roll
Leave them clothes at the door
What you waiting for,
better come and hit ya goals
Uh, he jump in it both feet
Going to the sun-up,
we ain't getting no sleep
Seven days a week,
seven different sheets,
seven different angles,
I can be your fantasy
Open up, say, "Aah"
Come here baby
let me swallow your pride
What you on I can match
your vibe
Hit me up and
I'mma Cha-cha Slide
You make Mondays feel like
weekends, I make him
never think about cheatin'
Got you skipping work
and meetings, fuck it,
let's sleep in, yes
(Seven days a week)
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday, Saturday,
Sunday (A week)
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday,
seven days a week
Every hour every minute
every second,
you know night after night
I'll be fuckin' you right,
seven days a week
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday, Saturday,
Sunday (A week)
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday,
seven days a week
Every hour every minute
every second,
you know night after night
I'll be fuckin' you right,
seven days a week
